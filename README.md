Models, Scripts and Slides from "Untrustworthy Hardware and How to Fix It"


# <!> Under Construction <!>
Buildscript currently does not support programming the Parallax Propeller; will update soon. Initial device did what this project was meant to do (OS linux workflow), but is still far short of my vision for the platform.   Big changes inbound, this show is just getting started.

# Future Plans:
- move from Intel/Altera Cyclone IV FPGA on the prototype system to the Lattice ICE-40 platform with OSS tools (they have more than enough gates to pull this off)
- single custom-board assembly
- increased system independence 
- consolidated IO interface
- RF hardening (optical IO interface)

# Bill of Materials:
- Hatchbox PLA used for printed components
- DE0-Nano running the MOR1KX open-source CPU: https://www.adafruit.com/product/451
- Parallax FLiP Propeller open-source microprocessor: https://www.parallax.com/product/32123
- 2X Adafruit PowerBoost 1000C: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465 (overkill)
- 2X 6600mAH Lithium-Ion battery packs: https://www.adafruit.com/product/353
- 2.8" Adafruit SPI TFT LCD: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1770
- PS/2 breakout: https://www.adafruit.com/product/804
- 2x 100ohm resistors 
- 2x 10kohm resistors 
- 4x M3 screws
- M2.5 standoff kit (for general assembly)
- 3.3v FTDI-compatible serial interface (for debugging)
- Access to a 3d-printer ~20-30 hours total print time (depending on quality / printer specs)
